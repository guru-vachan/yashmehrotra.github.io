      <description>This post was originally written on lambda.grofers.com
Currently at Grofers we are growing rapidly. And with this rapid-growth comes a huge amount of data. As we all know the (not so) famous saying:
 With great amount of data comes an itching need to analyse it.
 As the size of our data is growing rapidly, we have to analyse the trends that push our product forward.
We use PostgreSQL as our primary datastore.</description>

      <description>This post is about how me and Avijit retrieved multiplie cyberoam username/password combinations using python. This also highlights how vulnerable the system is if you are not using a more secure password . Even the default password given to us by the College are being recycled for many years.
